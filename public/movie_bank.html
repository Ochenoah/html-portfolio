<h2>A COLLECTION OF COMMENTARIES ABOUT MOVIES I'VE WATCHED</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>A BEAUTIFUL MIND</h3>
<p>I remember feeling so connected to this dramatized story
    about John Nash. I had feelings to do great things and be considered 
    a beautiful mind as well. I was in school when I first watched the movie.
    I can't remember the date as of now but it was in my university days.
</p>
<h3>THE NOTEBOOK</h3>
<p>So far, I've actually watched this movie just once.
    I remember that I use to see it as a recommendation everytime 
    I went online for some movie recommendation. I felt like there
    was some kind of hype about it being one of the great romantic movies
    and that was a turn off for me. Eventually I watched it and was actually pleasantly surprised.
    I didn't think I'd like it but I ended up liking it.
</p>
<h3>THE ULTIMATE GIFT</h3>
<p>I've actually watched this one several times. I used to cry when watching it but I haven't watched
    so there is no telling how I'd feel watching it again. I liked that it talked about things as gifts and showed
    the maturing process of the main character from a vain and entitled child to a living being conscious of 
    of others and acknowledging the importance of Love in Life.
